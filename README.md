Contains the code that I used to analyze the contents of the appendices of each cookbook for my spanish essay. The repository is structured as follows:
- ```imgs```: folder containing images of the appendices that i investigated.
- ```essay4.ipynb```: ipython notebook containing the code i used to clean the extracted text from the appendix and scrape the prices of each item of interest.
- ```NuevasAppendix.txt```: text file containing the raw appendix text extracted from nuevas recetas
